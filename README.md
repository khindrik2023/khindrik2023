- 👋 Hi, I’m @khindrik2023
- 👀 I’m interested in filmmaking, coding, health, and jiu jitsu.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking Harvard CS50x and The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
- 💞️ I’m looking to just learn for now since I'm still a noob, but I'd love to collaborate on web or AI related projects in the future.
